            <h2>Hi, I'm Katrina Lohr...</h2>
            <p>and I am a Senior Communication Major student at Carroll University! After graduation in the spring of 2023, I will continue my education at WCTC, where I will obtain dual degrees in Interior Design. Thus far, my career has focused on building positive team repertoire, production of comprehensive instructional materials, and creation of conflict management resolutions in a variety of diverse situations. One of my recent projects required creation of training materials for  newly hired employees, in which I compiled, organized, edited and proofed existing training materials into operationalized checklists. This resulted in increased efficiency of daily operations, and reduced new employee's uncertainty about performing new tasks. I believe in applying this same level of clear communication in all environments. Being someone who has worked in a variety of customer-facing positions, I strive to create a welcoming and efficient atmosphere that satisfies both a company's and customer's expectations. Having been a liaison between the customer and corporate world, my interpersonal skills, technical focus, and critical thinking are essential in maintaining positive workplace relationships.</p>
