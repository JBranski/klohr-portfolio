            <h2>Exit Essay</h2>
            <p>Over the course of the past four years as a Communication student, I have learned many skills that I never expected to learn as a part of this major. When I first signed up for Com101, I thought that the class would be focused on persuasive public speaking. While persuasive public speaking was a part of the class, it only covered one part of what I learned. Communication extends beyond a one way message directed at another individual. Even when it does not seem like it, such as delivering a speech to an audience, communication is an interactive process. For this reason, to become an effective communicator an individual has to understand not only themselves and the message they want to convey, but also how the receiver reacts to the message. Based on their reaction, the message sender must alter how they communicate-both during and after each interpersonal interaction-to help reduce confusion and enhance clarity. Additionally, communication and language are not synonyms. Language refers to the written and spoken word, whereas communication encompasses verbal language and nonverbal cues. In short, language does not have to be present in order to communicate with someone. While these ideas about communication may seem like common knowledge, my learning and understanding of these core principles throughout Com101 is what made me select communication as my major. My knowledge and skills pertaining to communication, however, took a long time to learn. Despite my struggles, I have grown to be a better communicator. My knowledge about communication strategies have been and will continue to be valuable in my personal and professional life.</p>

            <p>As described in previous sections of this website, one learning objective for Communication students is to be able to conduct systematic inquiry skillfully. This skill, however, did not come naturally to me. In high school, I was not taught how to identify a reputable source beyond merely identifying the suffix of a website. So it came as a shock when in Com150 I was expected to read peer reviews journal articles for our research project. Compared to websites, journal articles are structured to provide a reader lots of background information on a subject prior to explaining its findings. Adjusting to this new style of communication was difficult for me, as I did not know how to identify what information from the article was most relevant to my own research projects. In my initial draft of the literature review, my group received an overall score of a B. The sections that needed revision were the sections I worked on. In order to become a better writer, I took on the responsibility to revise the literature review to improve on my comprehension of the journal articles. With the help of my professor, Dr. King, I realized that I focused too much of my attention on the literature reviews of each journal article opposed to the discussion section.</p>

            <p>While a literature review provides a great overview of a subject, it often goes beyond what you need to know for your research project. Additionally, literature reviews look at what information is known at the time of the publication of the journal article. It is essential to use and analyze many journal articles to gain an understanding of all current research, as more knowledge about a subject is gained every year, which can be found in the results and discussion sections. My newfound understanding of how to interpret journal articles allowed me to drastically improve my own literature review, with the final grade for that section being an A. I have maintained and developed this skill in my other communication courses as well. This semester I was required to write a literature review for my individual research project, in which my draft received 24/24 points. Being able to conduct skillful systematic inquiry has made me a better communicator because I am able to interpret a wide variety of documents and explain their meaning to others.</p>

            <p>Many individuals underestimate the power of communication because they believe that they have already learned that skill. While communication is a soft skill, it needs to be consistently worked upon to remain proficient in it. For this reason, one of my greatest strengths as a Communication student is my ability to recognize the faults in my own communication patterns and improve upon them. One recent example of this occurred during my interview process for my Com499 capstone project. For my project I conducted a series of one-on-one interviews, in which I had made a series of questions to ask my participants. Prior to conducting this research project, I never interviewed another person. After conducting the first interview, I recognized that I let my uncertainty about conducting an interview affect the way in which I communicated with my participants, specifically in asking too many closed ended questions. This led to me taking more control over the conversation, which conflicted with the reason why I chose interviews in the first place: I wanted research participants to tell me about their experiences in as much detail as they wanted, without feeling limited by a character count or any other factors. By recognizing how I was asking questions, and how it was a problem for my research project, I then was able to revise the way in which I asked questions for the rest of the interview I conducted. This not only benefited the conversations I had with participants during the interview process, but also the quality of information I have to analyze for my research project. Listening is a bigger part of communication than talking.</p>

            <p>Starting next year, I will continue my education at WCTC through their Interior Design program. I chose to earn my degree in Communication before I pursued Interior Design because clients can struggle to articulate what they want in a design. By having the ability to know and overcome communication issues I will be able to provide better service to my clients and hopefully in turn create spaces best suited to their needs and wants. Additionally, interior designers do not work in solitude. Oftentimes they are a part of a construction or design project  start to finish. This means I will be put into a lot of situations in which I am not an expert about a given subject, but have to provide reasoning to my clients about why I made the design choices I did. For example, I may rely on a plumber to figure out where I can have sinks located in a building and structure my design around those fixed elements. However, if a situation arises where a client wants a feature in a location that is not possible, I will have to explain why it cannot be done. My knowledge of conflict resolution will be valuable in this profession, as coordination between different manufacturers can be stressful and time consuming. Being able to come to mutually agreeable solutions can ensure that project deadlines are met without sacrificing the quality of work and design. With everything that I have learned through being a Communication student, I anticipate that many roles I take on in my future profession will require me to be a liaison between peers, clients and vendors. Having a strong foundation in communication knowledge and practices will promote teamwork, accountability, and compassion, all of which are necessary to maintain healthy relationships.</p>
