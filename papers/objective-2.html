            <h2>Objective Two</h2>
            <p class="obj-text">Skill in responsible and sensitive communication with diverse others.</p>
            <p>As a whole Carroll University strives to encourage all students to experience and learn from diverse cultures. This, of course, implies that students should learn to be sensitive communicators, which is why this skill has been a crucial learning objective within the Communication major. Communication major students practice skills in responsible and sensitive communication with diverse others through the courses required for all Carroll students, and through the completion of the class Com207. In this courseCom207, I was asked on various occasions to examine the cultural and minority standpoints of characters found in films. One such example involved a reflection of a movie titled Dallas Buyers Club. For my paper, I wrote in depth about how the main character went through the stages of Minority Identity Development after being diagnosed with AIDS. The purpose of this paper helped me be able to identify and understand that society helps an individual construct their identity; however, their identity is not fixed. Over the course of an individual's life, they may become more privileged or disadvantaged-for example, in health-that can cause them to reckon with who they are now compared to who they were. Acknowledging that identity plays a huge role in an individual's culture, and vice versa, is the first step in being able to hear and understand viewpoints that differ from your own.</p>
            <p>In my Communication classes, there was never an instance where we examined the identity of an actual human and their privilege. In modern society, there is still stigma around individuals opening up about their privilege, because it can be uncomfortable to be compared to another individual. The most valuable skill I learn from Com207, is to stop and pause when I have a strong reaction or belief that differs from what another person believes. In those moments, I am recognizing my own biases and my assumptions. One example of this in my personal life beyond the classroom took place when I was discussing accessibility with one of my coworkers about how lines are structured during the holiday season. Initially, I had suggested to structure the lines that would be similar to a spiral so that it would require less line dividers. However, upon reflection I realized I had assumed all guests would be easily able to navigate around the line dividers and fixtures, which fails to take into account the customers who have accessibility issues. Without reflection upon my assumption, I would not have thought of a better solution to ensure inclusivity of all customers, specifically creating horizontal lines that had less turns. Diversity is not just a synonym for culture, it encompasses all facets that make up a person's identity. Therefore it is necessary to be kind and respectful of all individuals, especially in situations where diversity can easily be forgotten.</p>
