            <h2>Objective One</h2>
            <p class="obj-text">An understanding of the theories and principles of human communication that will facilitate their professional and personal effectiveness.</p>
            <p>Throughout my first semester at Carroll, I struggled with deciding what I wanted to major in. I enrolled in Com101 initially because I thought my experiences in high school would aid my public speaking abilities, which was a requirement for that course. As the semester went on, however, I realized what I enjoyed most from the class was learning about the various communication theories that explored why people communicate in the ways that they do. In Com101 one activity that we did to better understand interpersonal communication was by watching the movie The Breakfast Club. While watching the film, I was instructed to take notes on the film about the relationships between the various characters. A month or so later, on an exam for the course, I was asked to apply various communication theories to the movie. One example that I wrote about Expectancy Violation theory and how the actions of John Bender violated the group's expectations of societal norms. My understanding of this theory made it so that I received full points on that exam question. One exam question, however, is not sufficient enough to demonstrate my understanding of various communication theories. I cite this exam because it was the first moment that I felt confident in my abilities to apply communication theories to “real life” situations, even if they were done in a movie.</p>
            <p>It was not until I took Com319 that I had the opportunity to get an in-depth understanding of communication theories. For the final paper of this course, I had to apply 8 different communication theories to various chapters found in the book The Goon Squad. This project required me to have an in depth understanding of communication theories, as I had to determine which chapters represented the theory the best. This was a difficult task, as there can be many situations in which multiple communication theories could be used. With my own thorough deliberation, I was able to create compelling arguments of how each theory was present in each chapter, proven by my final grade of A in the class.</p>
            <p>Throughout my learning as a Communication Major, I can see how my knowledge of communication theories can, and have influenced my professional and personal effectiveness. Over the last year, there have been many situations at my workplace that resulted in disagreements between co-workers. Being a Senior, it was my responsibility to diffuse and resolve these agreements. When doing so, the issue I often saw was a concept that is known in the theory Coordinated Management of Meaning, specifically unwanted repetitive patterns. By encouraging my co workers to talk about the issue they were having without starting the conversation in the same way as they had done in previous conversations. By taking my knowledge of communication theories, and explaining it in a comprehensive way to my coworkers, they were able to solve the issue at hand and create a more effective way to express their needs from other departments. </p>
