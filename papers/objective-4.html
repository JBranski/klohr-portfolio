            <h2>Objective Four</h2>
            <p class="obj-text">The ability to develop and convey oral and written messages effectively.</p>

            <h3>Oral Messages</h3>

            <p>Throughout high school, I always thought I was an effective oral communicator. This was largely due to the fact that I was a part of a club called forensics–which focused on competitive oral speeches and demonstrations. While I did learn many skills from being a part of this group, I was not prepared for the requirements of speeches in Com101. Unlike the type of speeches I was delivering in high school–namely memorized speeches–Com101 required all students to become proficient in extemporaneous speeches. This meant that I had to become comfortable with not memorizing a speech, and focus on effectively delieving my message through working off of key points.</p>

            <p>This was not an easy task, and I struggled for the first few weeks of the semester to not read verbatim off of my notes. For the first demonstrative speech, I lost points on my delivery because I was too focused on my script and did not devote any of my attention to the audience. With the teachings of my professor, Dr. King, I discovered that one of the most common mistakes made with extemporaneous speeches is that individuals prepare speeches by writing out everything they want to say, and then try to practice the speech based off of the complete script. Individuals struggle to break away from the script, since it is easy to read it verbatim during anxiety-inducing situations, such as delivering a speech. This is exactly the situation I found myself in for the first demonstrative speech. To overcome this challenge, I stopped writing complete speeches and started to create speech outlines. By doing this, I was forced to elaborate on any of the notes from the outline verbally. This made me an effective oral communicator, since I had to learn to convey my messages in many different ways, since I would not phrase my point in the exact same way for every speech, even if it was about the same subject. Additionally, by not having a script in front of me, I could turn my attention to the audience. By watching the audience&apos;s nonverbal cues, it indicated which sections of my speech required more explanation, and gave me the opportunity to offer clarification that I would not have been able to if I was solely immersed in a script.  Evidence of my improvement was seen in the persuasive speech of Com101, where I received full points on my delivery.</p>

            <p>Effective oral communication is not only about the manner in which you deliver a message, but also in understanding your audience. By learning to use speech outlines, I was able to deliver extemporaneous speeches in the second half of Com101 and redirect my attention to the audience. The skills I learned in Com101 continue to have an impact on my professional development. Whenever I am preparing for an interview, or creating training material for my employer, I make an outline of key points with the intention of being an active member in the conversation. Opposed to focusing solely on the information I want to deliver to my audience, I rely on their nonverbal cues and behaviors, to help indicate what information I should elaborate on during our conversation.</p>

            <h3>Written Messages</h3>

            <p>When I think of a written message, the first format that comes to mind is a double spaced, 12pt Times New Roman essay, that is structured to make a compelling argument. Why do I think of this? This format has been used across disciplines, and has been the default way for students, such as myself, to convey our proficiency and knowledge of certain skills or ideas. While this format is effective for educational written messages, I have learned throughout various Communication courses that this format is not ideal in every situation that requires me to convey a message to an audience.</p>

            <p>Being able to select the correct channel for a message can be just as important as the message itself. As discussed in other parts of this website, in Com290 my classmates and I created a hypothetical campaign that was meant to persuade hesitant college students to get the COVID-19 vaccine. In this campaign, we were responsible for researching and writing about our target audience. The essay we wrote did follow the format described above, as it was meant to be an in depth education analysis. However, in addition to this essay my team and I created various campaign materials, such as flyers, radio messages, storyboards, brochures, that would hypothetically be used in a normal campaign. I demonstrated effective written communication throughout each of these formats as my team and I had to make statements that would grab the audience's attention. For example on the flyers we used call to action verbs in big point size fonts to grab the attention of a reader, and draw them into reading the rest of the flyers information. Similarly we had to have the same impact on a radio broadcast script and recording, but due to the limited time this channel presents the message had to be adjusted to direct the audience to other ways to gain more information about the hypothetical campaign. Had we done a long informative script, it would be less likely for the audience to pay attention to our campaign. A written message can be well written, but without an audience's attention it will not be effective.</p>

            <p>Another example of my effective written communication skills is when I made new training materials for my employer. I applied my knowledge of the importance of channels from Com290 by choosing to make operationalized checklists for daily tasks opposed to the former paragraph descriptions. While this change seems minor, it forced me to write in a concise manner that was easily comprehensible. This resulted in effective written communication as new trainees could easily identify what tasks needed to be done without needing to sift through large sections of text. My skill and understanding of written communication formats will be valuable in my professional development because I can communicate information in a way that will draw an audience's attention and not be overlooked.</p>
