            <h2>Objective Three</h2>

            <p class="obj-text">The ability to conduct systematic inquiry skillfully</p>

            <p>Within the Communication major program at Carroll University, there are many classes that encourage students to conduct systematic inquiry. Systematic inquiry is the process of conducting and interpreting research in a meaningful way. On its face this process may seem ubiquitous among many different majors; however, this process is developed incrementally for students studying Communication.</p>
            
            <p>One such class that I took that demonstrates my proficiency in this skill was Com150. In this class, I along with a group of other students were expected to conduct a research project that was designed to add to communication literature. One of the first steps was to collect, analyze and discuss what knowledge is known about the chosen topic. For my group this subject was on persuasive messages on crowdfunding platforms, specifically which messages influenced individuals to donate to a cause. This project demonstrates the third learning objective since students, including myself, had to determine reputable sources and understand their findings. As stated in this learning objective, skillful application of systematic inquiry also must be demonstrated. In order to pass this part of the Com150 assignment, I had to learn to write in a manner that did not just summarize individual research studies, but identify common themes found across many studies. This is not an easy skill to develop. My groups' initial draft of this assignment required a lot of improvements and corrections. It was my responsibility to make these corrections for our final draft. The biggest mistake made in the initial draft was that some paragraphs had similar ideas but were separated from each other. I resolved this issue by restructuring the paragraphs to follow the progression of ideas that many studies shared. The result was receiving an overall grade of an A- on the section, which was a letter grade higher than the initial draft.</p>

            <p>While Com150 was a class designed to hone systematic inquiry, it was not the only communication course that required my application of the skill. In Com290H, one of the research assignments was to work collaboratively with my classmates and create a white paper on Covid-19 vaccination hesitancy. In order to create a successful campaign, extensive research had to be done on vaccinations and fears surrounding it to better understand my target audience. I had to then skillfully apply the knowledge I learned to write a campaign slogan that would be persuasive to my audience. The research I gathered directly impacted the slogan the class created, and guided the execution of the other requirements of the project. I know that I was successful at demonstrating systematic inquiry in this project as the final grade on this project was an A.</p>

            <p>Systematic inquiry does not have to just be done through extensive literature analysis, it can also be done through everyday interactions.  How I conduct systematic inquiry in a customer facing position is to examine what formats of questions asked at a register result in customers buying additional products. When upselling to a customer, they are more likely to buy an additional product or add-on item if the question is relevant to what they are already buying. For example, if a customer is ordering a latte, suggesting an additional shot of espresso will be more successful than asking if they want to buy a book. These interactions show my competency in systematic inquiry because I am able to gather information about a customer based on their order, and then apply that knowledge to how I will continue the transaction. Having the ability to conduct research thoroughly and then make it relevant to an audience is a valuable skill, especially in situations which require efficient communication.</p>
